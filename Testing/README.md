# Testing
*Preliminary test exam questions*
### We have looked at some static analysis tools like StyleCop, PMD, FindBugs and SonarLint. Explain how static analysis can improve code quality. Explain how it helped you in your project, if you used it.
* StyleCop
* PMD
* FindBugs
* Linters
*  SonarLint

### Security - Explain test levels, and what characterizes the individual levels. Then, relate to your own project.
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* System testing
* Load testing
* Static testing
* Acceptance testing

### Explain what kinds of test can be carried out without running any code. Explain how it can be used on non-code documents as well.
* Reviews
* Technical reviews
* Management reviews
* Audit
* Static analysis
* Linters

### Explain test activities, and how they are related to each other. Then explain the test activities you carried out in your project.
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* Refactoring
* Maintenance
* Continuous Integration
* Code reviews

### Testing is related to ensuring higher code quality. Elaborate on what characterizes high code quality, and what makes code testable.
* Testable code
* Names of tests
* "Sufficient" tests of a method or class
* Assertions, defensive programming
* Dependency injection

### Explain the concept of maintainable code, and how it's related to test. Explain how to find out if a code base is maintainable.
* Maintainability
* Product quality
* Temporal coupling
* Continuous Integration
* Static Analysis
* Dependency injection, inversion of control
* Low coupling, high cohesion
* Cyclomatic code complexity

### Explain unit testing, and what characterizes it in contrast to other types of test.
* What and why
* Unit Under Test / System Under Test
* Unit test lifecycle (BeforeAll, AfterAll / SetUp, TearDown)
* Test doubles (mock, fake, stub, spy)
* Matchers (Hamcrest)
* Test Driven Development
* Dependency Injection
* Equivalence classes, boundary value analysis, equivalence partitions

### Explain test driven development, and how it affects the development process and code quality.
* Red, Green, Refactor
* Testable code
* Maintainable code
* Equivalence partitions
* Positive, negative tests

### Explain about test doubles. Explain how and why mocking is useful, and in what test areas.
* JMock, mocks, spies, stubs, fakes, dummies
* Dependency injection
* Interfaces, contracts
* Black-box vs white-box
  
### Characterize high quality software. Explain how writing tests can increase code quality.
* Defensive programming
* Black-box development
* Interfaces, contracts
* Inversion of control
* dependency injection
* Components

### Elaborate on dependencies in software, and how it's related to the subject of test.
* Dependencies between layers
* System resources
* Relations between objects
* Dependency inversion, Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection
* Mocks

### Explain problems in test automation, and how a continuous integration tool can help.
* What is Continuous Integration?
* How can a CI help regarding tests?
* What is a regression?
* What test levels can be covered by a CI system?

### Explain specification-based testing, and how you can be more confident that you have written a sufficient amount of tests.
* Equivalence partitioning
* Boundary value analysis
* Edge cases
* Decision tables
* Code coverage
